# Instagram_Uploader

This app allows you do upload images on your instagram directly from your computer.
To use it, you need to pick a photo that you wanna upload (currently supports only .jpeg files), place in into the same folder as this Python script and rename in to “image.jpeg”.

First of all you need to sign to you Instagram account by typing your username and password and then clicking on “Log In”.

Then you can write the description of the photo and hit “Upload”, your photo will now upload to 
your Instagram.
You can upload as many images as wanted without need to log in again, as long as you don’t close the application.

BEFORE RUNNING THE APP NEXT TIME, DELETE THE “CONFIG” FOLDER THAT HAS BEEN CREATED, OTHERWISE YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO LOG IN

Build on Python 3.8.
Before running, don’t forget to install all libraries from “requirements.txt.”.
